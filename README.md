# famous-quotes-app
Service written in Node using express.js 

This is my extension of a Code Academy course I completed on [express.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs), a powerful Node framework for writing backend services. 

In addition to the service I built a front end which allows the user to request a list of famous quotes, generate a random quote and also add a quote.

Yes, you guessed it - this is my way of demonstrating CRUD interaction using an API to the express service.
